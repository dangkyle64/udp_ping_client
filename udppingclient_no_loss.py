#The client program should:
# send the ping message using UDP
# print the response message from server if any was received
# calculate and print the round-trip time (RTT), in milliseconds, of each packet if the server
#responses
# otherwise, print “Request timed out”
# provide a sumAlice report at the end (of all pings) which includes:
# minimum RTT in milliseconds,
# maximum RTT in milliseconds,
# average RTT in milliseconds,
# percentage packet loss rate

#example
# firstname ping_number date_and_time
# Alice 1: server reply: Alice 1 Fri Sep 13 09:00:15 2024, RTT = 3.99 ms
# Alice 2: server reply: Alice 2 Fri Sep 13 09:00:15 2024, RTT = 0.00 ms
